To put text inside a circle with a width and height of 25 pixels in an SVG, you can use the `<text>` element and position it within the circle using the `x` and `y` attributes.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="12.5" fill="yellow" />
  <text x="50" y="50" text-anchor="middle" font-size="10" font-family="sans-serif">Hello, world!</text>
</svg>

```

In this example, the circle has a radius of 12.5 pixels, which gives it a diameter of 25 pixels. The text is positioned at the center of the circle using the `cx` and `cy` attributes of the `<circle>` element as the `x` and `y` values for the `<text>` element. The font size of the text is also reduced to 10 pixels to fit within the circle.

You can also use the `dy` attribute to adjust the vertical position of the text within the circle. For example, to position the text closer to the top of the circle, you can use a negative value for `dy`:
```javascript
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="12.5" fill="yellow" />
  <text x="50" y="50" dy="-5" text-anchor="middle" font-size="10" font-family="sans-serif">Hello, world!</text>
</svg>

```
