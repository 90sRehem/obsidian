To make a `div` element receive all CSS properties as props using styled-components, you can define a custom `styled` component that uses the `attrs` function to spread the props onto the element.

Here's an example:

```javascript
import styled from "styled-components";
import { CSSProperties } from "react";

export const Box = styled.div.attrs(props => ({
Â  ...props,
}))<Partial<CSSProperties>>``;
```

Now you can use the `Div` component like any other element, but you can also pass in any CSS property as a prop. For example:

Copy code
```javascript
<Box 
	fontSize="2rem"
	color="#333"
	margin="1em"
>
	This div has a font size of 2rem, a color of #333, and a margin of 1em. </Box>
```
Note that not all CSS properties are valid JavaScript object keys, so you will need to use camelCase for any hyphenated property names. For example, `font-size` should be written as `fontSize`.
